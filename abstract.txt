Network-on-Chip (NoC) has become increasingly popular in recent years as a communication paradigm for multi-processor systems-on-chip. However, its popularity entails a growing interest of adversaries to compromise such systems, mandating the integration of security measures into NoC designs.

This thesis concerns itself with the threat of hardware trojans, which may be introduced into such systems during the chip design and manufacturing process. Three different communication schemes with the goal of counteracting such trojans are developed and presented. By combining encryption, authentication, and network coding techniques, they ensure confidentiality, integrity, and robustness for all communications passing through a NoC. Additionally, four different routing strategies are employed to reap the benefits of multi-path routing. Furthermore, the approaches are specifically targeted towards the constrained environment of systems-on-chip, and thus particularly emphasize high performances via low latencies and low occupied chip area.

All presented communication models are evaluated through extensive software simulations. Four comprehensive metrics are used that capture the suitability of a model from different perspectives. The results confirm that the impact of hardware trojans within the network can be significantly reduced with a reasonable performance penalty.
