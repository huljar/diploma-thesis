As mentioned in Chapter \ref{ch:introduction}, this thesis follows up on previous work done at the \thechair. In 2015, the effect of network coding
on communications in a partially compromised \gls{noc} was evaluated and discussed. Now, the emphasis lies on combining network coding with
cryptographic measures to fulfill the protection goals (see Section (vref to fundamentals)). % TODO: move this to introduction?
% Mention that NoC will be simulated
