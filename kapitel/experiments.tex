\section{Parameters}
In the experiments, a base network injection rate of 0.2 is assumed\footnote{The actual injection rate can be higher once \glspl{arq} come into play
and retransmissions are required.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Injection rate
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Value if 0.2 is realistic
            \item Possibility to generate pairs for fair comparison of UC/NC
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Attacker Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variable number of compromised routers (e.g. 8 for an 8x8 grid)
    \item Compromised routers randomly drop or modify packets (no intelligent modifications/drops)
    \item Reasoning for having only some compromised routers (in regard to the 3rd party NoC problem â†’ why would they not make all routers the same?)
\end{itemize}

\section{Environment}
% 50,000 cycles (why?)
% Warmup and cooldown times
