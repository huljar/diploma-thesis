\section{Parameters}
In the experiments, a base network injection rate of 0.2 is assumed. This is the same value that \citeauthor{moriam18activeattackers} have chosen
\cite[2]{moriam18activeattackers} in order for the results to be comparable with their analyses. The actual injection rate may be higher as the base rate does not include the
issuance of \glspl{arq} and the resulting retransmissions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Injection rate
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Value if 0.2 is realistic
            \item Possibility to generate pairs for fair comparison of UC/NC
        \end{itemize}
    \item Overhead von Verschlüsselung+Auth vs. nur Auth vs keins von beiden (sowohl Latenz als auch Chipfläche)
\end{itemize}

\section{Attacker Model}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Focuses on malicious modifications rather than DoS attacks
    \item Assumption: compromised routers → rely on NIs for security
    \item No protection against bandwidth depletion, but this is not the goal here
    \item Variable number of compromised routers (e.g. 8 for an 8x8 grid)
    \item Compromised routers randomly drop or modify packets (no intelligent modifications/drops)
    \item Reasoning for having only some compromised routers (in regard to the 3rd party NoC problem → why would they not make all routers the same?)
        → HT implies more logic in routers → more area and draws more power → might attract attention if all routers have this and overall NoC
        parameters diverge considerably from the expectations
\end{itemize}

Compromised routers: 6, 8, 23, 36, 46, 52, 59, 61 (8 routers randomly selected from the set of nodes with uniform probability distribution)

\section{Determining The Hyperparameters}
\subsection{ARQ Timeouts}\label{subsec:arqtimeouts}
In Section \ref{subsec:arqretransmissions}, the concept of \glspl{arq} and timeouts was introduced: receivers issue \glspl{arq} when the temporal gap
between the arrival of flits belonging to the same transmission unit becomes too large, i.e. when a timeout occurs. Its value is determined through
experiments and measured in clock cycles.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{arq-timeouts-calc}
    \caption[Example of ARQ timeout calculation]{Example for the calculation of \gls{arq} timeouts. With a Manhattan distance of 4 between source $S$ and
    destination $D$ and a given inter-arrival timeout $t_1$, the \gls{arq} timeout $t_2(S, D)$ is computed as $t_1 + 2 \cdot 4 = t_1 + 8$ cycles.}
    \label{fig:arqtimeoutscalc}
\end{figure}

In addition to the inter-arrival timeout, there is another, higher value that is used after an \gls{arq} was issued to await the answer, as explained
in Section \ref{subsec:arqretransmissions}. The \gls{arq} answer timeout depends on the inter-arrival timeout and the Manhattan distance between the
two affected communication partners. More precisely, if $t_1$ is the inter-arrival timeout, $t_2(S, D)$ is the \gls{arq} answer timeout for a
particular source $S$ and destination $D$, and $d$ is the Manhattan distance between the two nodes, then $t_2(S, D) = t_1 + 2 \cdot d$. Figure
\vref{fig:arqtimeoutscalc} illustrates this calculation.

Hence, only $t_1$ needs to be determined through experiments. Since this is the first parameter to be fixed, the other input values for the simulation
are estimated. The tests are independent of the protocol variant as the same injection rate is used for all of them. Table \vref{tab:setuparqtimeouts}
presents how the simulator is set up.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{C|C|C|C|C|C}
        \pNCMode{} & \pEncMods{} & \pAuthMods{} & \pARQLimit{} & \pARQTimeout{} & \pRStrat{} \\\hline
        G2C3 & 5 & 15 & 1 & varying & \gls{dor} \\
    \end{tabulary}
    \caption[Input parameters for ARQ timeouts experiment]{long}
    \label{tab:setuparqtimeouts}
\end{table}

To determine the timeout value, an uncompromised \gls{noc} (i.e., with zero malicious routers) is used. Ideally, no \glspl{arq} are issued in this
scenario. However, due to random deviations from the average flit injection rate, the network load varies over time and congestions in some routers
may occur. The resulting increased transmission delays may be high enough to trigger timeouts even when an \gls{arq} is not necessary. Sporadic
occurances of such cases cannot be ruled out, but should rarely happen. However, simply increasing the timeout until these cases vanish is undesirable
for two reasons. First, a high timeout directly corresponds to high latencies when flit losses necessitate \glspl{arq}. Second, the later an \gls{arq}
is issued, the larger the \gls{rtb} of the communication partner needs to be so that the flits in question are not already overwritten when the
\gls{arq} arrives. The goal of this experiment is to find a reasonable middle ground: the smallest timeout that does not entail a significant number of
unnecessary \glspl{arq} will be used for the subsequent evaluations.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{gnuplot/plots/arqtimeouts}
    \caption[short]{long}
    \label{fig:resultsarqtimeouts}
\end{figure}

Figure \vref{fig:resultsarqtimeouts} shows the results for timeout values ranging from 3 to 15 cycles.

% As a starting point, a timeout of 8 cycles is used. It was identified as the optimal value in a previous thesis about \gls{rlnc} for
% \glspl{noc} \cite{yan15rlnc}. However, it may not be optimal for the scenarios investigated here since the protocol differs and a new simulator is
% used with a different network interface structure.
