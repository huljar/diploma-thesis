\section{Network-on-Chip}\label{sec:networkonchip}
Research on new and efficient ways to interconnect components on a single chip has been an important field of research for decades. The concept of
general-purpose on-chip networks has been introduced in the early 2000s
\cites{dally01routepacketsnotwires}{kumar02networkonchip}{benini02nocparadigm} and has quickly gained a lot of traction in the research community
\cite[e.g.][]{ivanov05nocintroduction}. With the ever-increasing design complexity of modern chips \cite{mack11mooreslaw}, specialized on-chip
interconnections become infeasible to implement; designing such a system "would take too much time and mapping of applications to dedicated architectures would
be impossible" \cite[1]{kumar02networkonchip}. Thus, the \gls{noc} approach was devised to "facilitate […] modularity by defining a
standard interface" \cite[1]{dally01routepacketsnotwires}.

\Glspl{mpsoc} that utilize \glspl{noc} typically have a large number of processing elements that can run many different
tasks in parallel. \citeauthor{ancajas14fortnocs} have shown that the threat is relevant, especially in cloud computing setups, where several
untrusted applications may run at the same time. \cite{ancajas14fortnocs} % TODO: move this out of related work? also drop the untrusted applications part

As the popularity of \glspl{noc} increases, so does the interest of adversaries to compromise \glspl{mpsoc} that implement them as their communication
backbone. In recent research, many different attack vectors have been explored, and a variety of countermeasures has been proposed to mitigate
attacks. The following sections will present them in detail.

\section{Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithms}\label{sec:lightweightcrypto}
For security reasons, it is often desirable to add encryption and authentication to the communication passing through a \gls{noc}. However,
standard cryptographic algorithms such as \gls{aes} are usually not efficient enough for this task. \cite[1]{bogdanov07present}
In the work preceding this thesis, lightweight cryptographic algorithms were thoroughly explored. \cite{harttung17lightweightcrypto} Such
algorithms are
specifically designed to have efficient hardware implementations with low area and power requirements. In addition, they aim to have a small
computation delay while still providing an adequate level of security. Examples of such algorithms are PRESENT \cite{bogdanov07present},
mCrypton \cite{lim06mcrypton}, PRINCE \cite{borghoff12prince} and Klein \cite{gong12klein}. Some of them will be explained further later in this
thesis. % TODO: reference this when explaining PRINCE later on

Different attacker/threat models in literature. Depending on the attacker model, different approaches are used to protect the system against it.
E.g. when the underlying network architecture (the NoC itself) is assumed to be compromised, protection is implemented in the network interfaces
of the nodes. If the attacker only has access to specific parts of the routers or specific zones of the NoC, protection can be implemented through
the routing algorithm. → The power of the HTs differs. The more complex the HT is, the stronger it influences chip area/power consumption/runtime
overhead and may be easier detectable → that's why HTs are often assumed to use "small" attacks like fault injection, or have access to only very
specific components of the NoC to stay undetected/not require much chip area.

Differentiate between methods to detect HTs (on software level, firmware level, w/ static analysis, side-channel analysis), and methods to harden
the NoC against potential HT infections.

NI is usually assumed to be trusted, and routers are potentially compromised because of 3rd party IP or 3rd party manufacturing/integration
partners. Other threat model: software attacks (NoC itself is secure).

How to get HT into hardware: rogue employee, 3rd party IP, 3rd party manufacturing/integration partners, ...

This thesis: no hardware synthesis, use software simulation. Focus on malicious flit modification (→ attacker model) rather than DoS attacks. Our
model assumes that the NoC routers and links may be compromised and thus relies on the NIs for the security measures → no effective protection
against bandwidth depletion, but this is not the goal.
Deterministic vs. static routing? No security zones or division into secure/non-secure zones/cores.

The concept of security zones can be implemented in different ways. Bla et al. propose to do X, while bla enforce them through the routing protocol.
