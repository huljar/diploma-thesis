\begin{itemize}
    \item Uncoded transmission
        \begin{itemize}
            \item no network coding
            \item 2 methods: 1 data flit + 1 MAC flit OR 2 data/MAC split flits
        \end{itemize}
    \item Flit structure
        \begin{itemize}
            \item burst bit, source/target address, mode, address, GID/FID, GEV, payload
            \item mode: define if data/mac/split/arq
        \end{itemize}
    \item Network coded transmission
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Number of flits: G2C3 or G2C4
            \item 3 methods: 1 data flit + 1 MAC flit OR 1 MAC flit per generation OR 2 data/MAC split flits
        \end{itemize}
    \item ARQs
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Limited number of ARQs per transmission unit (UC: data/MAC pair or split pair, NC: generation)
            \item Timeout of x (e.g. 8) cycles until first ARQ is sent
            \item If limit >1: start larger timeout (→ round-trip of ARQ)
            \item Many different cases, insert some flow diagrams here
            \item The higher the ARQ timeout/limit, the less likely the flit is still in retransmission buffer
            \item → ARQ timeout/limit and retransmission buffer size have to correlate
            \item In the case that we only have 1 ARQ left that we are allowed to send: Wait for any ongoing MAC verifications
                so in case they fail, the flits can be included in the ARQ
        \end{itemize}
