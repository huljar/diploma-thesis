\begin{itemize}
    \item Different attacker models/smarter attackers
    \item If attacker model changes, i.e. attackers start to drop specific/whole generations,
        how does that influence the Routing/ARQ design?
    \item My idea of G3C4 with generation MAC as part of the G3? â†’ ask if this is feasible
    \item Authenticated encryption schemes in the NIs
\end{itemize}
