\begin{itemize}
    \item Sequential IDs for uncoded and network coded → full transmission unit loss can be detected, ARQ issued
    \item Authenticated ARQs
    \item Different attacker models/smarter attackers
    \item If attacker model changes, i.e. attackers start to drop specific/whole generations,
        how does that influence the Routing/ARQ design?
    \item My idea of G3C4 with generation MAC as part of the G3? → ask if this is feasible
    \item Authenticated encryption schemes in the NIs
    \item Local network coding, local encoding vectors
    \item Burst mode (w/ head and tail flits)
    \item TDM route selecting
    \item RNG for path selection in simulator → according to \cite{stefan11enhancingnocs}, non-static selection can be very expensive in area →
        explore static routes?
    \item Intelligent attackers → modify ARQs or send own ARQs → they are unauthenticated so DoS attack by maximizing retransmissions
\end{itemize}
