\begin{itemize}
    \item Different attacker models/smarter attackers
    \item If attacker model changes, i.e. attackers start to drop specific/whole generations,
        how does that influence the Routing/ARQ design?
    \item My idea of G3C4 with generation MAC as part of the G3? â†’ ask if this is feasible
    \item Authenticated encryption schemes in the NIs
    \item Local network coding, local encoding vectors
    \item Burst mode (w/ head and tail flits)
    \item TDM route selecting
\end{itemize}
